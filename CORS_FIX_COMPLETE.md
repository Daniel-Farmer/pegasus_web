# CORS Configuration Fix - Complete

## Issue
The application was experiencing CORS errors where the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header was being set to `*` (wildcard), which doesn't allow credentials to be included in requests. This was causing authentication to fail.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by conflicting CORS configurations between:
1. Better Auth's internal CORS handling
2. Next.js middleware CORS headers
3. Next.js config headers
4. Better Auth route handler

## Solution
The fix involved consolidating all CORS handling into the Better Auth route handler to prevent conflicts:

### 1. Modified Auth Route Handler
**File**: `src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`
- Wrapped the Better Auth handlers to explicitly control CORS headers
- Added proper OPTIONS handling for preflight requests
- Set specific origin instead of wildcard (`http://localhost:3000` for dev, `http://37.114.41.124:3000` for prod)
- Enabled credentials support

### 2. Removed Conflicting CORS Configurations
- **Middleware**: Removed CORS handling from `src/middleware.ts` for auth endpoints
- **Next.js Config**: Removed CORS headers from `next.config.ts`
- **Better Auth**: Kept the CORS config in `auth.ts` but the route handler overrides it

### 3. Key Changes
```typescript
// In route.ts - explicit CORS control
const addCorsHeaders = (response: Response) => {
  const allowedOrigin = getAllowedOrigin();
  
  response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', allowedOrigin);
  response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS');
  response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization, Cookie, X-Requested-With');
  response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true');
  
  return response;
};
```

## Environment Configuration
- **Development**: `http://localhost:3001` (frontend), `http://localhost:3000` (backend API)
- **Production**: `http://37.114.41.124:3000` (frontend), `http://37.114.41.124:3001` (backend API)

## Testing
- Build passes successfully: ✅
- All TypeScript types are valid: ✅
- ESLint passes: ✅

## Expected Result
With these changes, authentication requests should now work properly with credentials included, and the CORS error should be resolved.

## Files Modified
1. `src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts` - Added explicit CORS handling
2. `src/middleware.ts` - Removed auth endpoint CORS handling
3. `next.config.ts` - Removed CORS headers configuration

## Next Steps
Test the application in browser to verify that:
1. Login/logout works without CORS errors
2. Session cookies are properly set and sent
3. API requests include credentials successfully
